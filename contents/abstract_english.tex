\begin{eabstract}
An abstract of a dissertation is a summary and extraction of research work
and contributions. Included in an abstract should be description of research
topic and research objective, brief introduction to methodology and research
process, and summarization of conclusion and contributions of the
research. An abstract should be characterized by independence and clarity and
carry identical information with the dissertation. It should be such that the
general idea and major contributions of the dissertation are conveyed without
reading the dissertation.

An abstract should be concise and to the point. It is a misunderstanding to
make an abstract an outline of the dissertation and words ``the first
chapter'', ``the second chapter'' and the like should be avoided in the
abstract.

Key words are terms used in a dissertation for indexing, reflecting core
information of the dissertation. An abstract may contain a maximum of 5 key
words, with semi-colons used in between to separate one another.
